This Policy is reflected in the \\nGroup’s “Open Door” philosophy, as detailed in the Employee Handbook, and the HR department is tasked with the \\nresponsibility of ensuring the success and effectiveness of the Policy. \\nPlease be assured that the HR department will always be available to support and assist employees to address their \\nqueries and concerns, and in meeting with this responsibility, it kindly asks that all employees respect the HR office as \\na productive workspace, where sensitive employee matters are treated and confidential records stored, and accordingly \\nsome measure of quiet and privacy is required to boost focus and productivity, and maintain confidentiality. To \\nachieve this, the following guidelines have been put in place to ensure a committed and effective open-door practice: \\n1. HR Physical Visit Hours –  \\nWhere there is need for an employee to physically visit the HR office for non-urgent personal HR related queries, \\ncomplaints or concerns, this may be done on Thursdays and Fridays only, between 10.00am and 4.00pm. \\n2. Other Days (outside Thursdays and Fridays) –  \\nOn other days, all queries, complaints and concerns should be handwritten or printed and placed in the designated HR \\nCompliant Box/Container by the foot of main building staircase and the same will be treated within forty-Eight (48) \\nhours of submission.  \\nNote: For urgent and sensitive employee matters that require immediate attention, the HR office is open daily \\nfrom Monday to Friday for physical visits, and employees are advised to visit only when absolutely urgent.     \\n3. Email Correspondence -   \\n \\nEmployees may also reach out to HR via email, using the HR.office@orangegroups.ng email address, as this remains \\nan effective channel of communication for all HR-related matters. Employees may submit written requests, seek \\nclarifications and address any issue that require prompt attention or documentation. HR will monitor the email \\nregularly to ensure timely and efficient response to all queries and complaints raised. \\n4. HR Phone and Intercom Line - \\nTo further enhance accessibility, a mobile call can be placed directly to the concerned HR personnel or employees \\nmay contact HR via the office telephone Intercom from their respective offices for matters that may be resolved \\nwithout the need for physical presence, or that does not require written communication. \\nThis guideline is in line with Section 4.8 of the company’s Employee Handbook and it is to ensure that the HR \\nDepartment remains open and committed to treating employees queries and concerns, and be able to receive ideas and \\nfeedback in order to promote open communication, while maintaining productivity and confidentiality at the HR. \\nThank you for your understanding.'),\n",
